We use a combination of Access tokens and Webhooks to authenticate and sync changes between GitLab and Mintlify.

* We use Access tokens to pull information from GitLab Mintlify.
* We use Webhooks so GitLab can notify Mintlify when changes are made.
  * This allows Mintlify to create preview deployments when a MR is created.
